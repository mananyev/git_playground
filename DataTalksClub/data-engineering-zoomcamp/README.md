# Data Engineering Zoomcamp

## Description

This folder is for DE-zoomcamp-2025 cohort that I participated in.


## Navigation

As of week 2, I have the following directories structure:

```bash
DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/  # my working directory
├── HAs   # solutions to home assignments
└── code  # code to set up resources for lectures and solutions
    ├── lectures  # scripts/config files used to follow lectures
    ├── week1     # all files for solutions collected by week
    │   └── ...   # (can have subdirectories)
    ├── week2
    └── ...
```


## Learning Script(s) and Notes

I tried to document all the steps I did to follow the video lectures in `./code/lectures`.
